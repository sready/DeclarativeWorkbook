# Module 3: Adding Fields to the Salesforce Request Object

In the first exercise you created a cloud app for managing Salesforce requests. Behind the scenes, the platform created a database for the app. A database organizes and manages data so that users can work with it efficiently. Traditional relational databases use tables to manage discrete, possibly related, collections of information, organized further into datatype-specific columns (attributes) and rows (records). In Salesforce, you refer to these as objects. 

Your DE org comes with many standard objects (for example, Accounts, Products, Tasks) that support pre-built and custom apps. Any new objects you create are called custom objects. The Salesforce Request object is one such custom object. In this exercise we are going to add a variety of different fields to capture the data we need to execute the Salesforce Request and get familiar with the field types that Salesforce has to offer.

The following image is a sneak peek of the data model you will be building, which allows you to view your objects, fields, and relationships.

Our Salesforce Request object will have fields that the user can populate so that the Salesforce Admin has the information they need create a new User or feature in Salesforce. You can add custom fields to list or track just about anything. In this section we will add a variety of fields to our new Salesforce Request Object.

1. Click **Setup** | **Create** | **Objects**.

2. Click `Salesforce Request`, scroll down to _Custom Fields and Relationships_, and click **New**.

4. For `Data Type`, select `Text`, and click **Next**.

5. Fill in the custom field details:
  - Field Label: `User First & Last Name`
  - Length: 60

6. Leave the defaults for the remaining fields, and click **Next**.

7. Click **Next** again to accept the default field visibility and security settings.

8. Click **Save & New** to save the User First & Last Name field and return to the first step of the wizard.
