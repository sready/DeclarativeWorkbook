#Module 7: Your App in Action on Salesforce1 Mobile

When you create an app in Salesforce, you automatically create a mobile version of the app. Indeed, you could say that every Salesforce developer is a mobile developer!
					
## Access the Mobile Browser App
					
There are three ways you can access the Salesforce1 mobile app.

1. As a downloadable mobile app you install on your phone.

2. By navigating to login.salesforce.com using a mobile browser.

3. By appending one/one.app to your Salesforce instance.

In this tutorial you’ll start by using the final option, because this is an easy way to develop and test on the same machine.

1. In your browser, open a new tab.

2. Copy and paste your Salesforce instance into the address bar of the new tab, and add /one/one.app to the end. For example, if your Salesforce instance has an URL of https://na4.salesforce.com, use https://na4.salesforce.com/one/one.app.

You should now see the mobile browser version of Salesforce1. Find the ‘Salesforce Request’ app in the left nav bar, navigate the app as a user and log a Salesforce request.
